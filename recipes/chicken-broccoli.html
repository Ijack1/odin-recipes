                <p>My Chicken & Broccoli Pasta recipe combines a creamy, soft cheese sauce sprinkled with tarragon with the salty, slightly 
                crunchy goodness of roasted broccoli. (And if you’ve never tried roasted broccoli before, you’re really missing out.) The texture 
                of slightly charred broccoli against the gooey softness of rigatoni pasta is just divine. So what I originally thought would be a super 
                basic dinner idea with evergreen ingredients, became a firm favourite in my house!</p>

                <p>It’s a simple dish that’s easily whipped up after work with ingredients I’m confident you’ll already have in your kitchen. Not to mention, 
                this pasta could easily become a vegetarian dish by simply omitting the chicken and using vegetable stock instead; it’ll still taste absolutely fantastic.</p>

                    <h2>Method</h2>

                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>First, prep your vegetables. Take your broccoli and cut into medium sized florets, spacing them out onto a baking tray and setting aside.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Finely slice your onion and celery, setting aside together. Then slice your garlic and pop aside too.</p>

                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Drizzle olive oil over the broccoli and season with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, half a teaspoon of thyme, half a teaspoon of tarragon and salt & pepper. 
                    Give it a good mix around with your hands to ensure the broccoli is well coated.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Pop your broccoli in the middle of your pre-heated oven for about 15 minutes. You want the broccoli to have taken on some nice colour with soft stems, 
                    but not too charred.</p>

                    <h3>Step 6</h3>
                    <p>Cut your chicken into chunks and season with half a teaspoon of thyme, half a teaspoon of oregano, a teaspoon of cumin and salt and pepper. Coat well.</p>

                    <h3>Step 7</h3>
                    <p>Add some olive oil into a pan on a medium heat, and then add your chicken. Fry for about 5 or 6 minutes until the chicken takes on a slight golden colour.</p>

                    <h3>Step 8</h3>
                    <p>Tip in your onion and celery, stirring often and cooking for another 5 – 6 minutes.</p>

                    <h3>Step 9</h3>
                    <p>Finally, add in your chopped garlic and cook for a further minute. Lower the heat slightly, so it’s more medium / low.</p>

                    <h3>Step 10</h3>
                    <p>Pour in your stock to deglaze the pan, scraping up any tasty golden bits. Wait about 30 seconds before adding your double cream and soft cheese.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 11</h3>
                    <p>Season the sauce further with a teaspoon of tarragon and black pepper, then squeeze in your half a lemon (careful of the pips!)</p>

                    <h3>Step 12</h3>
                    <p>Stir gently and let it simmer for about 15 minutes until thick, keeping an eye on the heat.</p>

                    <h3>Step 13</h3>
                    <p>Whilst your sauce is simmering, cook your pasta according to packet instructions. If you feel your sauce is getting a little too thick, add a dash of pasta water to loosen it up.</p>

                    <h3>Step 14</h3>
                    <p>Your broccoli will be nicely roasted by now, so simply add to the sauce, along with the grated parmesan.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 15</h3>
                    <p>Add your drained cooked pasta, stir it well and then serve in your favourite pasta bowl.</p>

                    <h3>Step 16</h3>
                    <p>Garnish with an extra sprinkle of black pepper and enjoy!</p>
